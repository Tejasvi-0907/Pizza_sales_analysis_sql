 PizzaHut Sales Analysis Project | SQL

In this project, I analyzed PizzaHut sales data using SQL to extract key business insights. I performed basic to advanced queries to:

- Calculate total orders, revenue, and most ordered pizza types

- Identify top-selling pizza sizes and highest-priced items

- Analyze order patterns by hour and average daily sales

- Determine revenue contribution and cumulative trends over time

- Segment pizza performance by category and type

This project showcases my ability to work with relational databases, write optimized SQL queries, and deliver actionable insights for business growth.
